CS6605 - Operating Systems II (Advanced Operating Systems)

This course teaches advanced operating systems concepts. The project involves writing an operating system kernel from scratch. This particular operating system runs on qemu (i386 emulator).

The kernel API includes: 
* Functions to print to the screen
* A heap to dynamically allocate memory
* Threading primatives such as semaphores
* Multiprocess support using the fork and join threading model
* Interprocess communication via pipes 

In addition, various examples are included such as:
* The dining philosphers problem
* A maze solver that uses A* 
* A blocking and non-blocking producer-consumer problem
